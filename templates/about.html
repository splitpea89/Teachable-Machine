    <h1>About This Page</h1>
    <p style="padding: 15px">For my teachable machine project, I decided to make a game of snake that can be controlled by physical signals. I went through multiple different Teachable Machine models to use for this, and this is the one I ended up with; some of the previous models didn't work well enough, like having the player point their head in the direction they desired, but I also tried to use poses, which I wasn't able to get working in time for the deadline. If I continue to work on this, I'll implement this new pose model, and I think it will greatly improve my game.</p>
    <p style="padding: 15px">Credit to all of the wonderful resources that made this project possible, like Teachable Machine, P5.JS, W3 Schools, and of course, Paul Way. </p>
